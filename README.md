**Final Course Submission: Deep Learning Capstone Project - WebProfiler AI**

This repository contains the final submission for the "Deep Learning: Mastering Neural Networks" course, including a PowerPoint presentation of the capstone project and a proof-of-concept implementation in Google Colab.

**Capstone Project Overview: WebProfiler AI**

In the cybersecurity domain, penetration testing is crucial for proactively identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. This project presents "WebProfiler AI", a tool designed to streamline the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing by automatically categorizing websites based on visual features.

Leveraging a VGG-16 neural network pre-trained on ImageNet, WebProfiler AI aims to improve the efficiency of the penetration testing process by aiding in target prioritization, automation, anomaly identification, and phishing page detection.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Pentest Screenshots (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altf42600/pentest-screensots) and has been restructured to better suit our needs. The goal is to enhance the original solution by refining the VGG-16 model's implementation, thereby achieving higher classification accuracy and providing a more robust cybersecurity tool.

Website categories include Custom404, Login, WebApp, OldLooking, Parked, Evaluation, and Undefined. Detailed descriptions of these categories can be found within the repository.
